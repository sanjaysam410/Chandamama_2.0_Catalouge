# Chandamama Magazine Metadata Project (1947-2012)

## Project Overview

This project aims to digitize and index the complete metadata of **Chandamama Magazine**, a legendary Telugu children's publication that has been serving readers for over 65 years. We are systematically extracting and cataloging stories, articles, and other content from each monthly issue published between 1947 and 2012.

## What We Have Done

We have developed an automated indexing system using **Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash API** to extract metadata from Chandamama magazine PDFs. The system:

- **Automatically extracts** story information from PDF files
- **Generates structured JSON metadata** for each magazine issue
- **Supports bulk processing** for entire years of publications
- **Includes verification UI** for manual review and corrections
- **Features auto-backup** to prevent data loss during processing

## Completion Status

### Overall Progress: **757 JSON files created out of 786 expected (Jul 1947 — Dec 2012)**

## How to Use This Data

1. **Browse by Year**: Navigate to any year folder (1947-2012) to find issues for that year
2. **JSON Format**: Each issue is stored as a JSON file with metadata including stories, authors, and content information
3. **File Naming**: Files follow the pattern `చందమామ_YEAR_MONTH.json` (in Telugu script)

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Missing Months**: Obtain and process PDFs for missing months in 1950 (Aug-Oct), 1951 (Oct), 1954 (Jan - verification required), 1956 (May), 1977 (Aug), 1994 (Aug, Dec), 1995 (Feb), 1998 (Feb, Apr, Jun-Dec), 1999 (Jan-Nov), and 2006 (Feb)
2. **Verify 1954**: Full verification required as per team notes
3. **Validation**: Cross-reference extracted metadata with printed editions for accuracy
4. **Enhancement**: Add additional fields like issue numbers, page counts, illustrators, etc.
